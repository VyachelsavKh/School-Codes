# School-Codes
The codes that I wrote during my studies at the gymnasium at Moscow State University.
Here I will publish in folders all projects that I wrote myself, or laboratory work issued by the teacher.
Some projects have already been written by me, but have not yet been published, while others will be published as they are written.
Since I write in c++ and c#, projects will mostly be written in these languages.
